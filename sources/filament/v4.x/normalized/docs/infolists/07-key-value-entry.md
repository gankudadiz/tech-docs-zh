title: Key-value entry
---

## Introduction

The key-value entry allows you to render key-value pairs of data, from a one-dimensional JSON object / PHP array.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
```

For example, the state of this entry might be represented as:

```php
[
    'description' => 'Filament is a collection of Laravel packages',
    'og:type' => 'website',
    'og:site_name' => 'Filament',
]
```

If you're saving the data in Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    { 
        return [
            'meta' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Customizing the key column's label

You may customize the label for the key column using the `keyLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
    ->keyLabel('Property name')
```

As well as allowing a static value, the `keyLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

## Customizing the value column's label

You may customize the label for the value column using the `valueLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
    ->valueLabel('Property value')
```

As well as allowing a static value, the `valueLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.
